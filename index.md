I am a grants administration professional with over 14 years of experience applying for and managing grant-funded research from a variety of federal, foundation, and industry sponsors.Â 
I am currently pursuing a graduate degree in environmental studies with the goal of bringing my grant leadership experience to the field of environmental conservation and research.
