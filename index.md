I am a grants administration professional with over 14 years of experience applying for and managing grant-funded research from a variety of federal, foundation, and industry sponsors.Â 

I am also a graduate student in the [VCU Center for Environmental Studies](https://ces.vcu.edu).  I am focused on bringing my project management and grant leadership experience to the fields of environmental conservation and research.
